# Flight Booking System - Flutter + Back4App

## Project Description

This project is a **Cross-Platform Flight Booking System** developed using **Flutter** for the frontend and **Back4App** (Parse Server) as the backend.  
It allows users to **register, log in**, and perform **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on flight records stored in the Back4App database.  

Key features include:  
- User authentication and session management using Back4Appâ€™s Parse SDK  
- Viewing a list of flights  
- Adding new flights with form validation  
- Updating existing flight details  
- Deleting flights with confirmation prompts  

The app is tested on an Android Emulator (Pixel 9, Android 15, API 35) and demonstrates smooth integration between Flutter frontend and Back4App backend services.
